# Macropad Custom Macro's # 
## I hope these will be helpful, they work on Linux & Windows. You will need to add consumer.py and keyconfig.py for some macros to work. There is no code.py editing needed from the default example. ##  

## NEW! Spotify ##
# The spotify binds include a special key to focus spotify or if it isn't running the script will start it up and then focus it.  Makes it super easy to go directly to Spotify despite what you may be doing at the time or what workspace your on.  The script is rof.sh in the main branch, it has two simple dependencies ```wmctrl``` and ```xprop``` 

My Custom macros :
```
Spotify - Spotify Music Player Commands
Github - terminal github commands
Linux-Firefox - Firefox shortcuts works with windows & linux (back&forward on win exception)
Media - media controls
Mouse - self explainatory
Navigation  - Arch based Linux Desktop Navigation
Navigations - Ubuntu baseed Linux Desktop Navigation
Numpad - self explainatory
Tones - Tones macro same as shipped with
Twitter - Twitter shortcuts
Vim - Vim editor terminal command shortcuts
Win-Youtube - Youtube controls
```
