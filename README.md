I hope these will be helpful, they work on Linux & Windows, you will need to add consumer.py and keyconfig.py for some macros to work, there is no code editing needed from the default example.  

My Custom macros :
Gamepad - Top number row for gaming keybinds
Github - terminal github commands
Linux-Firefox - Firefox shortcuts works with windows & linux
media - media controls
mouse - self explainatory
numpad - " " "
Sleep - All LED's off & Screen Sleep
Twitter - Twitter shortcuts
Vim - Vim editor terminal command shortcuts
win-youtube - Youtube controls 
Zoom - Zoom keyboard shortcuts, I'd reccommend going into settings and rebinding to your Macropad keys, some Zoom binds aren't cooperative with macropad so some are changed




Here's a youtube video of my pad & the custom macros so you can preview the colors & usages
